Security for large systems translates to security for everyone. Network security boosts client and consumer confidence, and it protects your business from the reputational and legal fallout of a security breach.
The right network security solution will help your business stay compliant with business and government regulations, and it will minimize the business and financial impact of a breach if it does occur. 
Your clients and customers rely on you to protect their sensitive information. Your business relies on that same protection, too. Network security ensures the protection of information and data shared across the network.
From allowing employees to work securely from any location using VPN to encouraging collaboration with secure network access, network security provides options to enable the future of work. Effective network security also provides many levels of security to scale with your growing business.
The network may have many visitors, but not all of them should have the same level of access. Access control is much like it sounds; it controls access to sensitive areas within the network. By recognizing each user and each divide, you can limit access to only known users and devices and block or limit access to unrecognized devices and users. 
Malware, short for “malicious software,” takes many forms to attack your network, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, or ransomware. While some malware acts immediately to steal or corrupt data, other malware is more stealthy, lying dormant before secretly infiltrating systems and information.
