Git hub actions will be used to create an automated CI/CD workflow for the marvel22 GitHub. 
CI/CD is an abbreviation for continuous integration and continuous development. 
GitHub actions can also be tied with slack to send messages with requests. 

Java has 3 types of automated tests that work with GitHub actions. 
This includes Ant, Gradle and Maven. 
GitHub provides tutorials on how to add these project management/build tools to the project. 
This feature allows for testing failures against the default branch. 
This should allow the developers to work more efficiently by 
spending more time writing code instead of fixing errors.
