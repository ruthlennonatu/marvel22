/*
The bug that shows when spot bugs is ran.

 Bug: There is an apparent infinite loop in spottestpackage.spotbugsTest.main(String[])

This loop doesn't seem to have a way to terminate (other than by perhaps throwing an exception).

Rank: Scary (8), confidence: High
Pattern: IL_INFINITE_LOOP 
Type: IL, Category: CORRECTNESS (Correctness)
