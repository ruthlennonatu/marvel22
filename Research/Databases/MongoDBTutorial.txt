This is a short tutorial on how to download and set up MongoDB.

1.First, head over to MongoDB official page "https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community" and download the community version.
2.After downloading MongoDB community server setup, you’ll go through a ‘next after next’ installation process. Once done, head over to the C drive in which you have installed MongoDB. Go to program files and select the MongoDB directory.
3.Open up your command prompt inside your C drive and do the following to set up a server and DB.The purpose of these directories is MongoDB requires a folder to store all data.
 -'C:\> mkdir data/dbC:\> cd dataC:\> mkdir db'
4.After creating those two files, head over again to the bin folder you have in your mongodb directory and open up your shell inside it. Run the following command.
 -'mongod'
5.In order to work with this server, you will need a mediator. So open another command window inside the bind folder and run the following command.
 - 'mongo'
6.After running this command, navigate to the shell which we ran mongod command (which is the server).
-'db'
7.To set up Enviroment Variables run the following command. This may differ from where you saved your path to.
 -'C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin'.

That is the basics on getting MongoDB up and running.

To view the current database you're in run the following command.
-'db'
To list your databases.
-'show databases'
To go to a particular database.
-'use <your_db_name>'
